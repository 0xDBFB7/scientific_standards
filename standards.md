it is hoped that eventually this might be machine-readable and integrated with hargrave in some fashion, 
if that ever becomes more than a pipe dream.



The argument could be made (I've argued as such before) that turning science, 
an institution founded on flexibility, into a set of perscriptivist doctrines, 
might stifle progress and creativity.

It might end up being a total waste of time!


Books regarding techniques are probably also good ways to get the same knowledge.

However, a cursory or Scientific Reports produces a most depressing opposition.
The accuracy very probably remained unchanged, but the volume ; and so the literature has devolved into a kind of blur;
it no longer offers any guidance on what problems to attack, which directions are fruitful.

of course, judging by the most infamous examples doesn't do justice to the best science.

ab initio if possible (relying as little as possible on specific manufacturers, reagents, etc),
 which is easy to say but hard to implement in practice.

 




culture template / standard database inside the main git repo - for each field or experiment
has best practices built in, tells you what to check
shouldn't require a PR to change - maybe a contact form built in?

Contact information for certain culture templates are built in; experts in certain fields can 
 explicitly agree to have their contact info added to check stuff?





besides the "expert list" (or maybe instead),
"user list" so breaking changes can be requested for comment - maybe even publications in the field?
