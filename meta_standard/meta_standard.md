# Field

### Scope: 

This standard is for the scientific investigation of interactions between 
electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields and biological systems, including:

- thermal []
- thermoacoustic []
- etc.

Because this is a matter of great public interest, many pseudoscientific concepts have appeared.
These are out of scope.

### Examples:

RF exposure standards 


# Other names

This field has also been referred to as:

bioelectrics[1]
bioelectromagnetics[2]


# Nomenclature, conventions, and acronyms 


new terms and acronyms SHOULD be discussed with the group before being coined.

## Rationale

[DC1, null consensus]:

Creating a new term or acronym is a great way to name a new technique. On the other hand, 
if this term does not become standard, your paper will be an island of terminology,
difficult to find.
